        <h1 class="heading" align="center">PRATAPGAD FORT</h1>
        <p class="fort-info">Pratapgad is a mountain fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. The fort is situated 24 kilometres from the Mahabaleshwar hill station. The fort is now a popular tourist destination.

        The fort's historical significance is due to the Battle of Pratapgad, which took place here on 10 November 1659, between Shivaji and Bijapur Sultanate general Afzal Khan.</p>

            <div> <br>
                <p>The Battle of Pratapgad took place on 10 November 1659, at Pratapgarh Fort in Satara. The battle was fought between the Maratha forces led by Shivaji and the Bijapur troops under General Afzal Khan. The Marathas emerged victorious, marking their first significant military triumph against a major regional power. In the aftermath of this victory Shivaji captured 65 elephants, 4000 horses, 1200 camels and 10 Lakh rupees of cash and jewelry.</p><br>
                <span>Appointment of Afzal Khan against Shivaji</span>
                <hr noshade>
                <p>In response to Shivaji's incursions and fort captures in the Konkan region, Ali Adilshah, ruler of the Adilshahi Sultanate, appointed Afzal Khan with 10,000 horsemen to confront him. The official history of Ali Adilshah's reign, the Tarikh-i Ali, suggests that Ali Adilshah ordered Afzal Khan to eliminate Shivaji, viewing him as a threat to Islam. Although some sources suggest that the intention was to capture Shivaji alive, the Tarikh-i Ali remains the most reliable account. Despite initial reluctance from other generals, Afzal Khan volunteered for the mission, demonstrating his confidence in subduing Shivaji. The force dispatched under Afzal Khan's command numbered around 10,000 cavalry, as documented in the Tarikh-i Ali. Notable noblemen and soldiers, including Ambar Khan, Yaqut Khan, and Musa Khan, were assigned to serve under Afzal Khan's leadership. This appointment marked a significant escalation in the conflict between Shivaji and the Adilshahi Sultanate.</p> <br>

                <span>Afzal Khan's Arrival at Wai</span>
                <hr noshade>
                <p>Afzal Khan departed from Bijapur around May 1659 on a campaign against Shivaji. While en route to Wai, conflicting accounts suggest that he desecrated the idol of Bhavani at Tuljapur and the idol of Vithoba at Pandharpur. These acts of vandalism aimed to humiliate Shivaji, as documented by various sources, including the Sabhasad Chronicle and the Shivakavya.

                Although the exact reasons for Afzal Khan's journey to Wai remain unclear, the Shivabharat suggests that it was prompted by Prataprao's betrayal of Shivaji's stronghold, Jawali, to the Adilshahi Sultanate. Afzal Khan viewed capturing Jawali as a strategic move to gain control over the Wai region, the Sahyadri mountains, and the coastal areas. Additionally, Afzal Khan's possession of the Wai Pargana since 1649 likely influenced his decision to use Wai as a base for his operations against Shivaji.Afzal Khan's arrival at Wai marked a significant development in the ongoing conflict between Shivaji and the Adilshahi Sultanate, leading to a pivotal confrontation between the two adversaries.</p> <br>

                <span>Initial Actions</span>
                <hr noshade>
                <p>Upon Afzal Khan's departure for Wai, Ali Adilshah issued farmans (royal decrees) to the deshmukhs (local rulers) in the Maval region, instructing them to join Afzal Khan's campaign against Shivaji. These farmans aimed to gather support for Afzal Khan's mission to confront Shivaji's incursions in the region. One such farman issued to Kanhoji Jedhe, a deshmukh in the Maval region, emphasized the importance of obedience to Afzal Khan's authority and the eradication of Shivaji's forces. Failure to comply with Afzal Khan's orders would result in severe consequences, as stated in the farman.In response to receiving the farman, Kanhoji Jedhe, along with his sons, sought counsel from Shivaji at Rajgad. Despite the potential jeopardy to his watan (land and property), Kanhoji remained steadfast in his allegiance to Shivaji, renouncing his watan and pledging his loyalty to the Maratha leader. Meanwhile, Shivaji mobilized his forces, ordering his cavalry commander Netoji Palkar to lay waste to enemy territory while he himself led his infantry to Jawali. Shivaji's strategic maneuvers and alliances with local leaders demonstrated his readiness to confront the advancing Adilshahi forces.On July 12, 1659, Shivaji arrived in Jawali, marking a significant development in the ongoing conflict between Shivaji and the Adilshahi Sultanate. These preliminary moves set the stage for a pivotal confrontation between Shivaji and Afzal Khan's forces at Wai.</p> <br>
                    <span>Incursions into Each Other's Territories</span>
                    <hr noshade>
                    <p>During the conflict between Afzal Khan and Shivaji, both sides engaged in incursions into each other's territories.According to the Tarikh-i Ali, Afzal Khan's forces swiftly entered Shivaji's territory under orders from Ali Adilshah. The account uses metaphorical language to describe the invasion, mentioning the thunderous sounds of drums and the dust kicked up by horses, but lacks detailed information.The Shivabharat provides a clearer picture, stating that while Shivaji prepared to confront Afzal Khan at Jawali, Afzal Khan's commanders launched attacks into Shivaji's provinces. These assaults resulted in Yadav attacking Supe, Pandhare invading Shirwal, Kharade advancing into Saswad, Siddi Hilal targeting Pune, and Saif Khan penetrating Konkan, previously occupied by Shivaji's forces. Afzal Khan's forces, according to the Shivabharat, inflicted significant damage on Shivaji's territories, reducing them to a distressed state. This assertion aligns with a letter written by Afzal Khan to Terdal Pargana officials on September 7, 1659, confirming Shivaji's army's destructive actions in Adilshahi provinces.</p> <br>
                        <span>Negotiations (October 1659)</span>
                        <hr noshade>
                        <p>In October 1659, Afzal Khan dispatched his envoy Krishnarao to Pratapgad to meet with Shivaji. Shivaji received Krishnarao and provided him with robes of honor, indicating willingness to engage in negotiations. Shivaji proposed holding the meeting below the Pratapgad fort.Meanwhile, Afzal Khan also sent a letter to Shivaji, expressing displeasure over Shivaji's actions and demanding surrender of forts and territories. Shivaji responded with a brief reply, acknowledging Afzal Khan's power and requesting a meeting in Jawali to discuss terms.The envoys exchanged messages, with Shivaji's envoy Pantaji Gopinath contributing significantly to persuading Afzal Khan to agree to the meeting in Jawali.

                            Different interpretations of events emerged from sources partial to Afzal Khan and those favoring Shivaji. While some accounts suggest Shivaji sought pardon and invited Afzal Khan for a meeting, others imply Afzal Khan's invasion forced Shivaji to seek reconciliation.Afzal Khan, despite objections from his advisors, decided to proceed to Jawali for the meeting. He left behind part of his army and provisions at Wai and advanced towards Jawali.
                            Upon learning of Afzal Khan's approach, Shivaji instructed his infantry commanders to conceal themselves near Afzal Khan's camp, prepared to engage if negotiations failed. Shivaji also ordered his commander Netoji Palkar not to initiate hostilities until the outcome of the meeting was clear.Netoji Palkar, returning from incursions into Adilshahi territory, received Shivaji's instructions to await further developments while remaining prepared for action.
                            
                            Ultimately, the stage was set for a crucial meeting between Shivaji and Afzal Khan, where the fate of their conflict would be decided through negotiations or confrontation.</p> <br>
                            
                            <span>Killing of Afzal Khan (10th November 1659)</span>
                            <hr noshade="">
                            <p>Shivaji had previously carefully guided his infantry and rangers, as we have seen before. The Jedhe Sequence records Shivaji's guidelines to the Bandal and Silimbkar contingents In a classified gathering that Shivaji held with his clergymen and Kanhoji Jedhe, it was concurred that the Muslim Afzal Khan is treacherous. The Bandal Deshmukh with his power will be in Jawali and in the woods of Standard. In the event that the Khan ought to act deceptively during the gathering, the Bandal Deshmukh shouldn't let the Khan's military set up camp in Standard rise the mountain fort, and support me Shivaji with select men. On the off chance that, by the endowments of goddess Shri Amba, Afzal Khan is killed, the Bandals will assault and completely obliterate the foe armed force in Standard subsequent to getting a sign from the post. Haibatrao and Balaji Naik Silimbkar are situated in the Bochegholi pass with their soldiers. They won't allow the foe to rise the pass. In this manner it was settled and organized in the mystery meeting."It shows up from this concentrate that Shivaji had allocated the errand of controlling the course between the spot of meeting and Afzal Khan's camp at Standard to the Bandals and their contingent. They were likewise told to go after the foe camp at Standard once they got the set up signal. Moreover, the errand of guarding the Bochegholi pass was given to the Silimbkars. In any case, no dependable data is surviving to tell us exactly where the other deshmukhs and their contingents or the regulars of Shivaji's power were positioned. Subtleties given in later date sources are temperamental. Shivaji and Afzal Khan met on 10th November 1659. It is notable that Shivaji killed Afzal Khan in course of this gathering. In any case, there is no arrangement in what different sources say about the event. What is sure, by the by, is that Shivaji killed Afzal Khan as he had recently settled."Shivaji started getting ready for the gathering in the wake of discovering that Afzal Khan had begun towards the gathering place at the foot of the Pratapgad Post. He loved God Shiva in different ways as prompted by the clerics, offered contributions according to day to day daily schedule, had a light lunch, tasted unadulterated water every once in a while, quietly petitioned God for briefly to goddess Tulaja, dressed properly for the event and looked at the impression of his face in a mirror. He rose immediately, made respect to the minister and different Brahmins and got their approval. He saw the Sun and afterward offered a cow alongside her calf and a gold in charity to a righteous Brahmin. He furtively situated his courageous devotees, who were anxious to go with him, for the guard of the Pratapgad post. Then he left to get the Muslim Afzal Khan who had come there considering unfairness, as agreeably as someone invites his visitor. Shivaji had wore fantastic reinforcement under his robe. He was wearing a white turban with a mantle and a robe sprinkled with saffron. With a sword in one hand and a patta
                                
                                — Shivabharat
                                in the other, he seemed to be Master Vishnu manifest who bears a sword in one hand and a mace in the other.
                                
                                "Shivaji, pacing energetically, dropped the post by walking and Afzal saw him drawing closer. Shivaji, as well, traded a look at his enemy with a grin. "The Khan, covetous of dissipating any sensation of doubt to Shivaji, gave over his sword to an orderly standing close by and, faking benevolence, shared with him in a boisterous voice:
                                
                                Oh! You who profess to be energetic for war and act in a very unshakable way! You have stepped some unacceptable way and, in your vanity, display no regard for the Adilshah, the Qutbshah or the powerful Mughal Ruler. I have come to chasten you for your presumption. Surrender these mountain fortresses and your ravenousness, and give up to me. I will by and by direct you to Bijapur, make you bow before the triumphant expert, Ali Adil shah, make a plea to him for your benefit and have him present extraordinary abundance to you. Oh ! Child of Shahji ! Child! Free yourself of pride in your insight and let me clasp your hand with mine. Come, embrace me. '"Saying this, the Khan squeezed Shivaji's neck under his left arm and hit a blow with his knife in Shivaji's side. The coordinated Shivaji worked himself liberated from the Khan's grip, parried the stroke of the knife and drove his own sword into the Khan's stomach. The Khan, staggered by the blow, attempted to hold his guts with his hands and shouted out that he had been killed. His worker unexpectedly surged at Shivaji with the Khan's sword ready for a stroke. The Khan had remembered this person for his company knowing great that Shivaji could never kill a Brahmin. Shivaji parried the stroke with his blade and, utilizing his patta, split the Khan's head into two....Thus on Thursday early afternoon, 10% November 1659, Shivaji slew the foe of the divine beings, Afzal Khan.
                                
                                According to the Shivabharat neither names Afzal Khan's Brahmin worker who, it, went after Shivaji, nor does it give any data about what befell the man a while later. In any case, it shows up from different sources that the Brahmin was Krishnaji Bhaskar. A few duplicates of the A. K.Chronicle say Krishnaji Bhaskar pointed a blow at Shivaji yet missed and, since Krishnaji was a Brahmin, Shivaji saved him, letting him go away. In any case, one variant of the narrative says that despite the fact that Krishnaji Bhaskar struck at him, Shivaji didn't kill him since he was a Brahmin; that he was killed by Jiva Mahala.!2®8 There is practically nothing to pick between the unwavering quality of these later date accounts. Killing a Brahmin was to be sure viewed as a wrongdoing in those times and Shivaji was no exemption for that conviction In any case, it is hard to surrender that Shivaji saved Krishnaji Bhaskar in the melee on the grounds that he was a Brahmin. Maybe Krishnaji Bhaskar was not killed on account of Shivaji and a few creators, exploiting the reality most likely trying to add to their hero's fame, recorded that Shivaji didn't raise his sword against Krishnaji Bhaskar in light of the fact that he was a Brahmin. Just a single duplicate of the A.K Narrative expresses that Krishnaji Bhaskar got away alive from the fracas. Considering this and from the quietness kept up with by the Shivabharat about Krishnaji Bhaskar's destiny, apparently he was killed. Understanding that Afzal Khan had been chopped down, his ten protectors - Abdul Sayyid, Bada Sayyid, Afzal Khan's nephew Rahim Khan, Pahlawan Khan, four other Muslims,and Pilaji and Shankaraji Mohite charged towards Shivaji to kill him. Shivaji protected himself with his blade and patta. In a matter of moments by any stretch of the imagination, Shivaji's ten protectors — Sambhaji Kawji, Kataji Ingale, Kondaji Kank, Yesaji Kank, Krishnaji Gayakwad, Suryaji Kakade, Jiva Mahala, Visaji Murumbak, Sambhaji Karwar, and Siddi Ibrahim likewise hurried forward. Jiva Mahala cut down Bada Sayyid before he could strike at Shivaji. The others immediately killed the rest of the Khan's gatekeepers Sabhasad writes The Shivaji himself killed in single battle the Khan who was essentially a genuine Duryodhan; as much in strength of body as in evil of heart. Bhima killed him independent. Comparatively did the Raja. Shivaji was Bhima himself. It was he who killed Afzal. This deed was not that of a person. A manifestation he definitely was, thus without a doubt might he at some point play out this deed. Achievement was accomplished."

            <p >
                <ul>
                    <li>At an elevation of 3454 ft, the fort is located in Satara district of Maharashtra. A winding, sharp mountain road leads to Pratapgad from Mahabaleshwar, about 21 km away. The fort was built to defend the Par Pass and played an important role in the defence of the region around Wai.</li> <br>
                    <li>From a distance, the fort looks like a round tipped hill with the walls of the lower fort giving the impression of the fort being a crown on the hill. Further fortification of the fort was later authorized by Shivaji and done by Moropant Pingale, the first Peshwa or the chief minister of the Maratha Empire</li> <br>
                    <li>The fort can be divided in to two parts, upper fort and lower fort. The upper fort was built on the summit of the hill. The layout of the fort forms a crude square and the walls stretch for approximately 590 sq ft on all sides. You can get stunning views of the Raigarh Fort and coastal Konkan from the top of the Pratapgad Fort.</li> <br>
                    <li>There are many structures in the upper fort with the Mahadev Temple being the most impressive structure. The temple is located in the northwest area of the fort near the edge with cliffs on three sides and a sheer drop of over 800 ft.</li> <br>
                    <li>The lower fort was built in a rectangular shape with a length of about 1050 sq ft and width of about 360 sq ft. To defend the fort, there are towers and bastions in the southeast of the fort which rise up to 40 ft. There is a Bhavani Temple in the eastern side that is dedicated to Goddess Bhavani.</li> <br>
                    <li>The battle between Afzal Khan and Shivaji was known as the Battle of Pratapgad after which the Afzal tower was constructed outside the fort on the approach road as a lookout for enemies. It is said that Afzal Khan’s head is buried under the Afzal tower which is also known as Afzal Buruj. The southern side of the fort has natural protection because of the rocky terrain and the eastern side has heavy fortification till the Afzal Burj.</li> <br>
