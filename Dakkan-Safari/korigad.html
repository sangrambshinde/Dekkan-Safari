	<h3 align="center">History</h3>
	<p>This fort was incorporated into his kingdom by the Maratha ruler Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj along with the forts of Lohagad, Visapur, Tung and Tikona in 1657. On 11 March 1818, Colonel Prother tried to take over this fort but even after a prolonged siege could not make any headway. Finally on 14 March, by igniting the stored ammunition by means of a loose cannonball he succeeded and this fort went to the British.</p>
	<p>Korigad Fort, also known as Koraigad or Kumwarigad, is a hill fort located in the Western Ghats near Lonavala in Maharashtra, India. It has a rich history dating back to ancient times. Originally, the fort was built by the Koli dynasty, who were the original inhabitants of the region.In the 15th century, the fort came under the control of the Bahmani Sultanate. Later, it was captured by the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur. During this time, the fort served as a strategic outpost to control the surrounding region.In the 17th century, the fort was captured and fortified by the Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Under his rule, Korigad played a significant role in the Maratha Empire's defense system, serving as a watchtower to monitor the movements of enemy forces in the region.After Shivaji Maharaj's death, the fort exchanged hands several times between the Marathas, Mughals, and the British East India Company during various conflicts in the region.Today, Korigad Fort stands as a popular trekking destination, offering stunning views of the surrounding landscape and serving as a reminder of Maharashtra's rich historical heritage.</p>
